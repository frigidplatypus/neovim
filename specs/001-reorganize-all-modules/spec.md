# Feature Specification: Module Directory Reorganization

**Feature Branch**: `001-reorganize-all-modules`  
**Created**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "reorganize all modules in the modules/ directory based on types such as core, ui, productivity, and more as submodules under the respective category"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature request: Reorganize nixvim modules into categorized subdirectories
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Neovim configuration maintainers, users importing modules
   ‚Üí Actions: categorize, reorganize, group modules by functionality type
   ‚Üí Data: existing module files in modules/nixvim/, module import paths
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain backward compatibility, logical categorization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific categorization criteria for edge case modules]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: maintainer reorganizes, users import from new paths
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement addresses categorization, path updates, compatibility
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Module categories, module files, import paths
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec addresses core reorganization needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: For modules that could belong to multiple categories (like a UI component that's also productivity-focused), what should be the primary decision criteria? ‚Üí A: Assign to category based on the module's most frequently used functionality
- Q: For composite modules like 'mini' that contain multiple sub-functionalities, what should be done? ‚Üí A: Keep as single module in the category that best represents its overall purpose
- Q: What should happen to existing import paths when modules are moved to new categorized directories? ‚Üí A: Update all import paths immediately with migration scripts
- Q: What should be the approach for modules that don't clearly fit into any of the proposed categories? ‚Üí A: Create new categories as needed for groups of similar modules
- Q: How many modules should constitute a "group" to justify creating a new category instead of using an existing one? ‚Üí A: Four

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Neovim configuration maintainer, I want to reorganize the modules directory into logical categories so that modules are easier to find, understand, and maintain. Users should be able to locate specific functionality types (like UI components, productivity tools, or core editor features) in dedicated subdirectories rather than searching through a flat list of 50+ modules.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current flat modules/nixvim/ structure with 50+ modules, **When** a maintainer applies the reorganization, **Then** modules are grouped into logical categories like core/, ui/, productivity/, git/, lsp/, etc.

2. **Given** a user needs to find all UI-related modules, **When** they browse the reorganized structure, **Then** they can find all UI modules in a dedicated ui/ subdirectory.

3. **Given** the reorganized structure is in place, **When** existing configurations import modules, **Then** import paths continue to work through proper module exports or migration guidance.

4. **Given** a new contributor wants to add a module, **When** they examine the structure, **Then** it's clear which category their module belongs in based on its functionality.

### Edge Cases
- When a module could fit into multiple categories, it will be assigned based on its most frequently used functionality
- Modules that don't fit existing categories will be grouped into new categories when there are four or more similar modules
- Existing import paths will be updated immediately using migration scripts
- Composite modules like 'mini' will remain as single modules in their most appropriate category

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST categorize all existing modules in modules/nixvim/ into logical functional groups
- **FR-002**: System MUST create category subdirectories including but not limited to: core, ui, productivity, git, lsp, formatting, search, and utilities
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain all existing module functionality after reorganization
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear categorization criteria for each category to guide future module placement
- **FR-005**: System MUST update all import paths immediately with migration scripts when modules are moved to new categorized directories
- **FR-006**: System MUST organize modules based on their most frequently used functionality when modules serve multiple purposes
- **FR-007**: System MUST keep composite modules like 'mini' as single modules in the category that best represents their overall purpose
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure the main nixvim module can still import all reorganized modules
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain consistent naming conventions within each category
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide documentation explaining the new organizational structure
- **FR-011**: System MUST create new categories for groups of four or more similar modules that don't fit existing categories

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Module Categories**: Functional groupings like core, ui, productivity, git, lsp, formatting, search, utilities - each representing a distinct area of editor functionality
- **Module Files**: Individual nixvim module configurations currently in flat structure, each with specific functionality and dependencies
- **Import Paths**: References to modules used by configurations, must be maintained or properly migrated
- **Category Assignment Rules**: Criteria for determining which category each module belongs to, handling edge cases and multi-purpose modules
